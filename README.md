# ReachOut

ReachOut is a platform designed to list and promote local vendors, home-based businesses, and roadside sellers. The platform focuses on providing exposure to small businesses, allowing them to connect with potential customers. With features like vendor management, business listings, media uploads, and customer reviews, ReachOut aims to bridge the gap between local vendors and their target audience.

## Features

- **Business Listings**: Businesses can create profiles, list their services, and provide detailed information.
- **Media Uploads**: Businesses can upload photos and videos to showcase their products/services.
- **Customer Reviews**: Customers can leave reviews, helping others make informed decisions.
- **Business Timings**: Detailed working hours and special notes for businesses, similar to Google Maps.
- **Location-based Search**: Customers can search for businesses near them based on proximity.
